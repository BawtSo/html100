	<h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>

	<h2>DC Heroes</h2>
		<p> <em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em><br>
		The storylines are more complex and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favorite is <strong>Green Arrow.</strong></p>

	<h3> Marvel heroes </h3>
		<p> <small><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more two-dimensional.</q></small></p>
	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<blockquote>To summarize, marvel isn't as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
		<p>  But have better movies.</p>
